Hello and welcome to my WEP dictionary script.

First things first. The following can only be run in a POSIX system. In my case I have used Backtrack If you want to use another POSIX system make sure to do:

                                                    apt-get install airmon-ng

                                                    apt-get install airodump-ng

                                                    apt-get install aireplay-ng

                                                    apt-get install aircrack-ng

    Create a folder ./Desktop/crackcap

    

    Open terminal and paste the script to: nano /usr/sbin/cackwep and save changes

    In terminal and write: chmod +x /usr/sbin/crackwep

    In terminal write: crackwep

Have fun
